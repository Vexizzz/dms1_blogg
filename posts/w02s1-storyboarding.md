# Slides

We learnt about continuity and the general rules when shooting, such as always having to keep to the 360 rule, the importance of continuity, the effects of disconuity, and making use of similar elements such as colours and poses, and etc. We also talked about what storyboarding is, and the quality they should convey as well as some examples. I really liked the quote from John Coven where he said that "You have one frame and you must be able to take one frozen moment from the entire shot and represent it in one or two frames‚Äù. I feel like it really represents the art of storyboarding and the flexibility it gives to how a frame can be shot. 

# In-Class Storyboard

We were given around half an hour in class to draw a storyboard for any video we wanted, and I decided to choose this one trailer of a character that I really liked, picking out the first scene.

# The Process

I first took screenshots of each frame that I wanted, then to ensure I got the proportions right, I split each screenshot into grids of 3. Afterwards, I started drawing each frame following them.

# Assignment Storyboard

Afterwards, right before class ended, I went on iPad Notes to start brainstorming for my assignment. I wrote any word that came up in my mind, then mapped everything out which can be seen in the process down below.

I plan to establish continuity by making use of match-cuts and using similar colours for background. An example would be trying to keep the colour scheme warm with comfy colours such as brown tones (the melbourne central clock bricks and the book backgrounds). I think a problem I'll face is making sure the assignment video does not end up as a narrative while trying to ensure temporal continuity.

The theme focuses on nostalgia and time, so I plan to use a lot of L-cuts to give the audience a lingering feeling on the last scene, like reminsicing since I really want to set a longing and slightly sentimental mood.
