# Slides

We learnt about continuity and the general rules when shooting, such as always having to keep to the 360 rule, the importance of continuity, the effects of disconuity, and making use of similar elements such as colours and poses, and etc. We also talked about what storyboarding is, and the quality they should convey as well as some examples. I really liked the quote from John Coven where he said that "You have one frame and you must be able to take one frozen moment from the entire shot and represent it in one or two frames‚Äù. I feel like it really represents the art of storyboarding and the flexibility it gives to how a frame can be shot. 

# In-Class Storyboard

We were given around half an hour in class to draw a storyboard for any video we wanted, and I decided to choose this one trailer of a character that I really liked, picking out the first scene.

# The Process

I first took screenshots of each frame that I wanted, then to ensure I got the proportions right, I split each screenshot into grids of 3. Afterwards, I started drawing each frame following them.
