# The End

Diving into Figma and pixel art for the first time has been a journey filled with both challenges and excitement. Initially, both tools felt unfamiliar. But thanks to Figma’s simple interface, it taught me to think more systematically about layout and structure. I found myself exploring on different ways in how to align UI elements, which encouraged me to break down complex ideas into smaller, more manageable components. It felt rewarding to slowly understand how these individual parts come together to create a cohesive design.

What I valued most throughout this process was how these tools nudged me out of my comfort zone. Instead of seeking perfection from the beginning, I learned to experiment and step out of my comfort zone; I played with new color palettes as I almost rarely use bright white and pink palettes, and learning how to do pixel art.

This experience has taught me that creative growth lies in trying new things and embracing the unfamiliar. Whether it's using Figma to design interfaces or pixel art to express a visual idea, both practices have opened up new ways for self-expression. I’m eager to apply this mindset to future projects, approaching them with curiosity and openness to new tools.

Ultimately, learning these skills has reminded me of the importance of creative exploration; even when things feel messy or intimidating at first, the process can lead to unexpected discoveries.
