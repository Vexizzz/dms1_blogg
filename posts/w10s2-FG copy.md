# Class Assignment

In class, we learnt how to use Figma for the first time.

![Shapes](/w10s2/first.png)

I learnt how to add shapes into my frame, then subtracting, union selection and doing all kinds of combinations with it that I had learnt to do in Illustrator during Assignment 2. I also learnt how to change the colour of elements as well as add text by simpling pressing the hotbox T, and how we change its properties using the side panel.

Afterwards, we were introduced to the interactive aspect of Figma, where animation and actions occur when hovering or clicking on one. We learnt how to create one by simply dragging the circle that pops up in the box to where we want it to navigate to on click.

Furthermore, while changing the interactions of the buttons in the website, I experimented with the "scroll behavior" found in the right side panel and figured out what each ones do.

# Homework

## Written Components 

To create an engaging folio, I’ve started drafting paragraphs that capture my personal progress throughout the semester. I aim to show all the work I've done with clear, concise information for the audience.

For my work:

"Drift through time" is a self portrait... which is edited and captured all through a phone... It aims to envoke nostalgia...

"Lo-fi Settlement" includes icons I've designed with this game in mind... how I've designed it... the environment it aims to create...

"Subway Sunset" is an explorable 3D environment... it's based off... description of what I want it to be...

## Figma Implementations

One of the useful things that I had gotten from the class would be learning how to change the desktop colour, as I think white would be too boring and having freedom in this creative aspect would be extremely helpful

Another would be the scroll behaviour of elements, as I figured that the ones that stay fixed would be helpful when creating elements to help users navigate throughout the sections of the webpage. Speaking of that, learning how to configure the elements' interactions would help me achieve that effect, and how to use animations such as either instant or smart animation, would help make the transitions seem smoother for a more enjoyable user experience.

## Visual Elements

As my projects engage heavily with themes of nostalgia, I’ve decided that the overall design of my webpage will reflect the aesthetics of old-style computer blogs—reminiscent of early internet spaces. I believe this retro-inspired design will align with the concepts I’m exploring, creating a sense of familiarity and playfulness. Using a nostalgic aesthetic also serves a deeper purpose: it mirrors my interest in how narratives are constructed across different times and mediums, inviting the audience to reflect on their own experiences with technology and storytelling.

Furthermore, I want the page to feel fun and engaging, which is why I’m leaning towards a colorful yet consistent palette with shades of pink, and white. These bright tones evoke a sense of optimism and creativity, this balance will help maintain the emotional complexity of my projects while keeping the design approachable. Not only that, the pink and white combination also references the visual aesthetic of early internet spaces; playful yet minimal, making users feel both welcomed and curious.

I plan to use a mix of monospaced fonts (like those used in coding environments) for headings, adding to the old-school computer vibe, and modern sans-serif fonts for body text to ensure readability. Additionally, I’ll incorporate:

I plan to use a mix of monospaced fonts (like those used in coding environments) for headings, adding to the old-school computer vibe, I already have a font in mind which is "Orange Kid", a font I often use when typesetting for game.  I'll also add in:

Pixel-style icons and elements to enhance the retro look.
Colorful hyperlinks to create a playful, interactive experience.
For layout, I’ll follow the structure of old blogs, vertical scrolling, but inside a computer screen inside the webpage.

By embracing this retro-blog aesthetic, I aim to reflect not only the concepts I’m exploring but also my personal taste as a designer. The design will convey my love for interactive media and nostalgic storytelling, as well as my desire to balance serious reflection in an easily digestable manner. I want visitors to feel like they’re exploring a space that reflects both the evolution of my ideas and the playful spirit of the early web. This design strategy ensures that my webpage will not only present my work but also embody the core themes that run throughout my creative practice. This design approach excites me because it bridges both the past and present, creating an experience that feels both meaningful and visually distinctive. However, this is still in its very rough  drafts of planning, and is bound to have some tweaks as I experiment further in Figma.
