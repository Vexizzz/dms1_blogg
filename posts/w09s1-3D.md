# CLASS ACTIVITY

In class, we had to playtest one another's games and provide feedback. I played a lot of my other classmate's works, and providing them my critique and thoughts, I also inputted that kind of insight into my own game as well. 

# HOMEWORK

For homework, we had to ask somebody we knew to playtest our game while giving them a set time to explore the environment.

My tester was my friend from RMIT who was part of industrial design. He spent a lot of time exploring everywhere but the place he should be heading to, such as heading in the opposite direction, and trying to find Easter eggs. He was disappointed when there were not anything, and when he went up, he was confused on what the point of the city was for. Confused on which direction to go, he seemed lost and wandered around without having anything to do. 

I took notes on this, and I ended up testing other of my friends, such as my highschool friends who loved to play video games. Sending 4 of my testers my google form, I noted a common feedback; 1. The music was too loud, thus rendering the footsteps inaudible, and the incredibly heightened sensitivity of the player's camera as well as speed made it feel as though you were rushing through the environment. It was a contrast to the calm mood that I had wanted them to be immersed in instead. Not only that, the lack of any barriers or small details made it feel empty and bland, leaving the player confused on how they should proceed, and interpreet the environment. 

In exchange, I decided to work on these problems. Firstly, I changed the speed and mouse sensitivity of the player, lowering them until I felt that it was enough.

Next, I lowered the music while increasing the footsteps, before finally adding more small details into the subway station. I tried barricading where the player should not be going by adding objects that matched with the scene parallel towards them, such as lockers against classrooms, and hospital seats and beds against a hospital room.

I furthermore added growing vines as well as overgrown plants to add to the post-apocalyptic and ruined vibes I wanted the subway station to encapture, further emphasizing how old and untaken care of the past had grown to be. 

Moving onto the second floor, which is the city, I also added roads to guide the player into walking and taking a scenic route around the playground located in the middle of the city. Not only that, I added trees to add to the shading and calming atmosphere of instead of an abandoned playground that you would have expected in the past, is a modern and clean one, unchained by the past and unrestrained by the tall and dark walls of the subway station. Instead it faces the bright scenery and sun, looking forward to a brighter future.

All in all, I had a lot of fun choosing out the small details actually; such as dinosaur books and toys since I had always loved dinosaurs, putting in floral growth and aspects, and even just creating the entire playground. I had always rarely gone to the playground due to my sick nature, but just like my creation, I had always viewed it as a warm setting full of life, no matter if there was anyone or not. Plants had always been my interest and my hobby, especially since the time I was hospitalized. I wanted to keep the environment as calm as possible, so I decided not to add any NPCs inside the playground, but instead many trees that casted shades and a sense of life that they themself provide with their greenery. Doing this assignment had taught me that no matter if I had planned the entire setting already, there will be something that does not follow through, and I should learn to be able to improvise, all the while sticking with design principles. Asking others, observing others on their gameplay and understanding their difficulties had helped in improvement since the initial stages, and gain creative insight and suggestions that I would have never had thought of before.
