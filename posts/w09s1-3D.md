# DESIGN

![Start](/w06s1/start.png)

In all the designs, I always start by making a circle first to enclose everything which is always the same size in every design. I made use of the rectangle shape a lot, softening the curves and curving them a lot. I often combined them in the pathfinder to make new shapes and objects, since manually moving each of them one by one is a hassle and is time-consuming.

While looking for ideas, I drew inspiration from Ivan Dubovik, a flat artist illustrator, and his way of colouring as well as soft shading which I felt gave off a very soft and friendly feeling which I was aiming for. I started with the base first, before slowly building upon the shading in order to not make it look too mundane.

I also made use of the rectangles' properties of "stroke" and clear "fill" to create boxes and windows, as seen in the properties panel at the right side of the screenshot I took while working on my designs.

Throughout the entire process, I made use of the ruler as well, keeping it constantly at 50 degrees to create a consistent shadown seen throughout all the designs. I'd create an extra layer on top which is in a darker colour, only lowering the opacity until its a little amount so it creates a shadow effect.

However, my designing process had a lot of changes and indecisivenesses which I have known for a long time has been a large issue for me. At first, I wanted to partake in the "Future" theme, yet nothing I was doing seemed to be working out. In the end, I decided to go for a home theme.

# SOUND

After a while, I also started collecting sounds for each icon as well, each depending on what they represent. For example, I thought the sizzling of a fire in a fireplace resembled this crunching of a plastic, so I tried to replicate it in a shorter and snappier way which you would expect from clicking a button on a website.

However, since the theme I chose was "home", it was manageable and accessible for me to find sound effects. For example, the icon with food on the pan has sound from a salt grinder, while the subtle thud of the bookshelf was the sound of setting down a heavy book, and the window's sound is supposed to resemble the quick woosh of opening a curtain.

# CODING

I started out first by uploading all of my files (the icons, icons when clicked and the mp3s) after copying the repository. I find this approach more manageable and tidier, whereas I do not have to wait for uploading times in the middle of coding and unsure if what I want has already been uploaded or not.

Afterwards, I start coding out the style such as the padding of the containers that would hold the icons, and declaring that the code is in HTML format. I also made sure to give my icons an action whenever hovered above; making use of the code provided in the templates provided by the tutor within the layout ZIP as well as the ones given in class and on Discord:

I have a habit of putting in comments in a lot of my coding, so I don't get easily lost within my writing as seen. I dedicate my body to becoming a 3x3 grid layout of the icons and giving each icon their own ID so it is easier to script their behaviour when clicked on further on. In this case, the icons are programmed to change to a specific image for a short moment when clicked, before reverting afterwards. I unfortunately was stuck here for quite a bit, simply because I had forgotten to put } after the end of each ID script.

However, after finding out about it, it had been smooth sailing and the rest was going just as smoothly. A problem I feel, though, is that when I first load the website, however, it takes a while before the interactive experiences work so I added a line where it will preload the audio since I think this problem is related to the browser's autoplay policy for media elements. And for the final touch, I changed the image container width slightly so it wouldn't look too far apart or stiff from one another.

All in all, the entire process was incredibly enjoyable although quite confusing at parts, especially the subtle hidden mistakes I can never catch while coding. Playing around with Adobe Illustrator has certainly improved my confidence and flexibility when it comes to graphic-design related projects. I especially had fun with the pathfinder tool and shape unity, it allowed me to explore unique design possibilities that kept the experience fresh and engaging.
