# Slides

We learnt about implementing audio to our video and the different kinds of effects they can produce. We had an activity, where we had around half an hour to capture a video, then after uploading them to a OneDrive, we had to edit someone else's using the sound effects we learnt.

I dragged the video and imported it into Adobe Premiere Pro, then muted the volume!

Afterwards, I went to YouTube's audio library to find some sound effects for the video. I wanted in particular some walking steps since the subject in the video was walking.

The subject in the video was walking further away, so I also wanted the walking sound effect to gradually become softer thus I decided to try to make the first audio snippet fade into the quieter version before finally fading off. After reading the slides presented in class how audios suffer from the most vulnerable to seeming unnatural after being edited. Thus, I think I favor fading audios more now since I think it'd sound unnatural.
