# Class Assignment

In class, we had to choose a website to create a wireframe for, however, we were to make it from memory. The website I had chosen was YouTube.

I first started with the rectangles of the videos in the average YouTube home screen, adjusting the corner radius to make the sides more curved. In order to speed up the process, I copy pasted a lot of the elements in order to keep the shape consistent as well.

Afterwards, I continued on with the circles in order to create the notification and channel icons viewers usually see at the top right side of the screen. I also added more rounded rectangles in the top middle to create a search button as well as for the YouTube icon. I thought it would look pretty similar to the original website on the Apple Mac, however, it was not. The proportions were off and several features such as the video categories on top would be missing. Thus, I redid everything, before finally reaching the final result.
