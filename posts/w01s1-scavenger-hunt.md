# Explosive cup of coffee.

We weren't quite sure if this was the right spot, but we figured we'd shoot it here since it was right across the building anyways!

We all immediately knew where this would be since we all passed by it while walking to class, haha. There's no way we got this wrong... right?

Oh wow, this one was probably the most time-consuming and troublesome one to find. We tried looking through the "art" section of the RMIT library at first, but Jill suggested trying to use the library search provided, so we did, but the problem was that we still didn't know how to read the locations stated of the book by the website. We ended up going to the upper floor and asking a librarian for help who thankfully helped us after 30 minutes of arduous suffering.

We went to the study lounge near the library after searching for the wisdom book, and found many students studying there. Seems like the perfect study space for a Sith Lord!

I think its definitely luck that we could actually notice all of these in one place LOL. When we saw the large wall, we all collectively agreed this was it.

# A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land.

Dispensing -> dispenser -> vending machine; SOO lucky one was nearby, especially one that was selling just drinks.

# A door for the condemned.

We were actually thinking hard if this location was really the right one, but another group of the same class came as well and told us of its setting's history, and confirmed it for us! 

# A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor.

We were running out of time and there was only 3 minutes left, so when we saw this place, we just yolo'ed it haha, not caring if we were wrong or not. Though the statue does seem like a curtain or cape, so hopefully it's right? 

# Final Thoughts.

Although we didn't get to complete all 10 of our Scavenger Hunt Checklist, we managed to attempt eight of them. Though it didn't feel disappointing at all since I got to talk with the people in my group, and introduce ourselves! I feel like having this game, even though its simple, is super helpful to get everyone to ease and open up to others. The tutor was also super nice and friendly, and he especially took me by surprise when I found out our class would be having a discord server; a platform which I think I'm definitely way more comfortable and easy to use. In a way, I felt really excited and more motivated to be able to ask more questions, since that has always been a problem for me in the past. I'm definitely looking forward to more studio sessions!!
