# CLASS ACTIVITY

![Start](/w06s1/start.png)

we made a Sketchfab account, and learnt how to import an asset as well as put a mesh onto it. I practiced with another model to try and get used to this process, since I would be importing alot of assets.

# HOMEWORK

Outside of class, I started importing the assets I had gathered over the previous weeks into my project, such as an abandoned classroom and a playground. However, I came across a problem, realising that my build size had already exceeded the terrain limit of 300. I debated for a while before deciding that a hospital room instead would be more befitting instead. As it is talking about a change I had undergone, I resonated more with the hospital room as I had always been often sick while I was younger. This caused me to often miss out on class as well as hangouts with friends. Thus, to me, the time I spent in classrooms in the past were moments I deeply cherished and held close. On the other hand, I visited playgrounds more often while I grew older rather than in my childhood. In Melbourne especially. I relooked back at my plans and changed a few design aspects, such as instead of having a playground be a childhood memory, but instead in the present "space" of the city.

I also started adding materials as well as textures onto the 3D objects that I had created. It was a mix of some I found online, and some I made myself on Adobe Substance 3D Designer.

Afterwards, I added the skybox, which I had so much trouble with since for some reason, it was not rendering and would not show up in game view. Because of the issue, I had to create a new project and transfer everything from the previous one. Ihad  looked in Unity Asset Store before settling on a skybox texture pack which I thought looked extremely pretty and matching to the warm, comfy aesthetic I had originally been going for.

In turn, the lighting and ambience of everything; both the subway and the city upstairs, changed and gave the warm tone I hoped for. I also started adding mesh colliders for the stairs. Instead of manually coding the player to climb up each stair and the physics, I opted for simply creating a sloped cube underneath the stairs that the player could climb; hiding the mesh renderer and giving it the mesh collider rather than each step manually. I felt that it was more time-convenient, and would be more easy on the load for lower-end pcs, as I would not want too many meshes crashing their devices out.

Afterwards I started working on the very inital basics of the city, importing some assets such as city buildings, while manually adjusting and creating additions to them in order to fit more into the environment and with one another.
