# CLASS ACTIVITY

I had fallen sick with a high fever so I was not able to join class. However, I tried following the slide instructions and read the content at home. I learnt about the relationship between the features of AudioListeners and AudioSources. 

# HOMEWORK

As homework, we had to watch chapter 9 of the Unity 3D 2023 Essential Training videos as well as gathered sound assets needed for the environment, music, sound effects and so on. Thus, I opted for royalty free music as they were the easiest to find and use, since their crediting and licensing were not too complicated and strict. I went to Youtube Music Library and gave a listen to the tracks under the "Cinematic and Calm" genre, before deciding on a very nice music that I felt matched the theme of nostalgia and the tranquility of self reflection.

It was then when I thought including footsteps as a sound effect would also be a great idea. I wanted to add some diagetic audio as well, in order to help the player feel more immersed and not create a too fictional and unnatural setting. Thus, I looked for more royalty free footstep tracks online before settling on one. I chose one that was not too fast, yet not too slow, and matched with the rhythm of the headbopping of the player that I had coded into the main camera.

I adjusted the code to match the pace of the footsteps, all done in Visual Studio Code.

Afterwards, I created another script, in where whenever the player inputs something, which in this case, could only be movement, the step audio would play and it would seem like there were footsteps.
