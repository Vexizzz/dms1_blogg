# Feedback

In class, we had to share with one another the progress of our webpage and provide feedback. My friend had commented on the lack of judgement when it came to composition, spacing, and positioning of my decorative elements, and the lack of consistency in the colour palette, especially the Nintendo DS:

Thus, I redrew the Nintendo DS with a more similar colour palette; with the webpage mainly following three shades of colours, #FFFFF, #F795AA, and #FEB9C8. The boxes I drew also all follow this three main colours in order to improve consistency;

Furthermore, I also received feedback that since the webpage was too zoomed in, it was hard and bothersome to scroll up and down to navigate throughout the sections. To fix this, I made an old-school webpage that followed the original theme using just rectangles in Figma; adjusting their stroke and increasing the corner radius to create a search bar of a search engine.

This made the content smaller and more engaging, all the while drawing and adding on pink pixel icons on the left side. I did this in hopes of it resembling apps of an old-school computer, adding app names using the text tool on Figma, and I added interactions to each "app" so they could navigate to each section more easily. I also made them in a fixed position, so users can move easily however they like,
