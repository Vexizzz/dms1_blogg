We had to do a visual code experiment, so I played around with the sizings and width of the containers and paddings, increasing everything;

And the result was that it was too large for the browser screen seen below.

On the other hand, making the padding really low caused everything the icons to be really far apart from one another which was really odd-looking.

While lowering the image container width causes all of the icons to be closer to one another as seen:

![Close](/w05s2/image%20(3).png)

I think that this would be useful when icons are too awkwardly far apart from one another. I experimented a bit more and it was really fun whenever I'd turn up one of the features to an extreme low or high, since the results would be unpredictable.
