# CLASS ACTIVITY

![Start](/w06s1/start.png)

we learnt how to edit the terrain as well as configure the player capsule settings. 

Playing with the terrain was really fun, and made me interested in creating new projects later on that make use of mountains or creative, uneven terrains. 

# HOMEWORK

I started making the grey prototype of my subway, starting first with a terrain of 300x300, and continuing simple while adding a few assets to help build the foundation. Using only cubes, I tried to recreate a subway station while looking at reference pictures of several others in real life. I figured adding a train asset for at first would save much time since I would be able to tell how large the subway station and terrain should be.

I also made stairs using only cubes, with the help of the "rect tool" which I found incredibly useful throughout the entire process as it was easy to use and navigate. I did not go far too much, however, as I wanted to keep it simple so I could figure out where I should proceed next.
