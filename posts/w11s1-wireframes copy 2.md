# Class Assignment

In class, we had to choose a website to create a wireframe for, however, we were to make it from memory. The website I had chosen was YouTube.

I first started with the rectangles of the videos in the average YouTube home screen, adjusting the corner radius to make the sides more curved. In order to speed up the process, I copy pasted a lot of the elements in order to keep the shape consistent as well.

Afterwards, I continued on with the circles in order to create the notification and channel icons viewers usually see at the top right side of the screen. I also added more rounded rectangles in the top middle to create a search button as well as for the YouTube icon. I thought it would look pretty similar to the original website on the Apple Mac, however, it was not. The proportions were off and several features such as the video categories on top would be missing. Thus, I redid everything, before finally reaching the final result.

# Homework

For our homework, we had to design several wireframes for our planned webpage. Using my iPad, I sketched out some initial designs:

My first design was initially what I felt I would most likely go through with since it felt professional, clean and neat. However, I felt like it was too simple and cliche; It did not represent any aspect of my creativity as a designer, thus why I set it aside.

![Second](/w11s1/second.png)

This design was too messy; I thought that the top pictures of my project at the top would be too clustered and messy. I also showed my design choices to my friends, to which none of them chose wireframe 3. It felt all over the place, and was also lacking something that I could not pinpoint. 

![Third](/w11s1/yay.png)

This was the original design I had thought of since the week before. I thought it would be too childish, however, it felt the closest to my creative aspect and was the most engaging towards my concept.

I was really hesitant in choosing the third one, especially since Figma was known mostly for its simplicity. However, I clarified with the teacher and found that using Illustrator was fine. I wanted to experiment with something new, especially since the design had been based off pixel art, something I had never done before.
