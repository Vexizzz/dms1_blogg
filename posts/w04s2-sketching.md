In class, we had to do a thumbnail sketching activity, where we had to produce 20 thumbnail sketches for a particular icon or logo of anything. Since I was really hungry at the time, I immediately thought of food. However, the catch was that there were only 10 minutes. I've always been super indecisive with whatever I made, thus I usually take a long time, so this really was a challenge for me. In the end, I only could make 18 so I added in an extra 2 to make up for it after the class.

Afterwards, we were tasked to produce a series of thumbnail sketches for Assignment 2, with at least five thumbnail sketches per icon.

The theme that I chose was "Home." To clarify, the ones that I circled in light blue were the ones that I liked the most.

The first consisted of pans or morely specific to homemade cooking. Although the sketch that I circled seemed plain in comparison to the others, I feel like that's one of the reasons why I liked it. Since the assignment was more towards flat design, I thought a simple bird's eye view of the food in the pan would be easy for anyone to understand and not too complicated. It would also be easier to show the contrast of the food against the pan, drawing viewers' attention more towards it. 

The second was of "windows". I was contemplating at the sketch right beside the circled one but I felt that it would be a bit too simple. I wanted to create a more "homey" vibe to it without doing too much, so I figured I could put a small little homeplant pot right next to it. It was the decision to this sketch that also helped me figure out which kind of colour palette I wanted to be using; Earth and homey tones such as brown, orangey yellow and calm green. Nothing too bright.

The third was of bookshelves or just shelves in general. When thinking of a home, the first word that comes to mind is usually something like "comfort" or "relaxation", and books are the perfect embodiment of that. According to several sources such as Medium and a study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, books remain an irreplaceable source of comfort, and emotional connection as they offer us company through both our ups and downs and provide solace. Furthermore, a study published in the Journal of Physiological Anthropology found that houseplants make you feel more comfortable, soothed, and natural. I feared the window and the bookshelf would look too similar, so I tried switching it up a bit, since they are also both the same shapes.

The fourth is of a coffee machine. Initially, I wanted to choose the one at the top right, but I felt that it was too stiff and awkward so I settled for one facing sideways.

It combines elements of contrast and color to convey both warmth and coziness. The use of a warm yellow light from the lamp not only breaks the monotony of a plain wall but also highlights the framed pictures, drawing the viewerâ€™s attention to them. It emphasises the feeling of "home" by creating an inviting and personal atmosphere, where the framed pictures symbolise cherished memories.

The sixth is of either a cabinet or a closet, which I decided to include a pet. The inclusion of a pet adds a lively element to an otherwise empty  icon of a cabinet or closet. Pets are often associated with warmth, companionship, and the essence of home. It makes the icon more relatable and visually appealing, adding an element of movement and character, balancing the design by breaking the rigidity of the furniture piece.

The seventh is the front door of the house. I picked the simplest one that showed a small glimpse of a window, just to show the audience that it is the front housedoor, rather than just any normal door inside. This subtle detail distinguishes it from other doors inside the house, which enhances its clarity and recognition as a front door. The simplicity of the design, paired with the small window communicates the idea without unnecessary complexity, aligning well with the principle of simplicity and emphasis.

The eighth is of a microwave. A front-facing, straightforward view of the microwave is what I chose because it immediately conveys familiarity and universality. Since microwaves are a common household item, it uses the principle of recognizability. The choice of a clean, minimalistic style emphasizes the microwave's utility and its association with comfort and quick, home-cooked meals, without overcomplicating it.

The ninth is a fireplace. For the fireplace, I wanted to keep the design simple and straightforward while using curvy shapes to give it a more homey and comfy feel. I wanted to use curvy lines and shapes to soften the overall look, combined with a warm fireplace feel more inviting and less rigid. I wanted to design it in an inviting approach that focuses on warmth and comfort, using soft, flowing shapes that evoke a sense of relaxation and a welcoming home environment, using the principles of emphasis, simplicity, and balance.

Overall, I wanted to pick out my sketches based on the elements of design to convey a sense of "home" through contrast, emphasis, and color. Although they are all visually distinct, I wanted to somehow keep them thematically consistent as well by ensuring it communicates the intended concept clearly and resonates with the audience's understanding of "home" and similar colour palette of earthy tones. I wanted to make my set of icons cohesive and expressive through the use of strategic design elements, all the while ensuring each individual icon subtly stands out on its own.
