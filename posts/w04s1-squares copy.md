In class, we had to do a black square activity.

We had to design 8 icons for each theme using only 4 black squares, so I firstly decided to make one singular square by holding down my shift button while dragging the M cursor. I changed the fill colour as well as made the stroke 0 through the properties panel. I wanted a similar one, so I copy pasted it.

While coming up with the many designs, I tried to make it so that the audience would understand, all the while being restrained by using only 4 black squares. For example, this design is for the theme "increasing". I tried to relate it to a common occurence such as walking up stairs, "increasing your elevation from ground". I tried to show the difference between the jumper and the stairs by tilting the smaller square upwards, hopefully giving it a more jumpy feeling as well.

Another example was one of my designs for "congested". I wanted to make it feel full and cramped by squeezing in a large square between the others, taking up most of the empty space.

In the end, I chose the final designs for each theme based off how well and easily they can communicate with the audience, as well as what I think resonates the most with the theme.
