# Slides

The slides talked about the definition of self portrait and discussed many different kinds of shots and transitions used in design and editing, such as crossfade, match-cut and etc. During the time after slides, we had to share the 30s footage we shot from the homework last session with another and practice editing techniques.

![The Tutorial](/w01s2/tutorial%20pp.png)

While editing, I watched a tutorial on Premiere Pro given in the Discord channel, AT1-Resources, and practiced the keyboard shortcuts since I'm still not used to them.

I first imported both video files into Premiere Pro, before deciding to try out the different simple transitions I've learnt in class. I muted the audio of my video actually since my friend's didn't have any; I wanted to make it consistent since I think it'd be unnatural if I didn't.

Then I moved to the 30s mark of the composition video so I can trim it to the exact frame. The videos now have a transition of a simple cut. I really liked how it turned out so afterwards, I wanted to try something else out now; A crossfade.

I first set up my "effects" panel from the window dropdown, then dragged the transition that I wanted to use to the cut line between the two clips. I actually experimented with every single transition one by one in the dropdown LOLOL but I settled on cross dissolve since it's the simplest and I wanted to go for a clean transition.

Now I had a crossfade transition. Yippee!! I wanted to try even more transitions as well, so at the end, I placed a fade to black just so that the ending doesn't feel abrupt but instead gradual.

I dragged it towards the end of the final clip, and now we're finally done!!

Lastly, I sent the file to Adobe Media Encoder so I can export it before finally uploading it to YouTube!

# Final Thoughts

While doing this practice, I realized just how many panels Adobe Premiere Pro has (along with every other Adobe app sigh) and how confusing this information overload can be to someone. Even after the class and the tutorials, I sometimes forget which keyboard shortcut is which, or which panels I need to open. Thankfully, Adobe has some really great tutorials that I often up while editing just in case, and they're formatted in such a neat and organized way that I loovee.

That's all I've done for the w01s2 session. It was my first time using Adobe Premiere Pro actually, and I went into class with low expectations of myself since I get easily overwhelmed with information overload and have difficulties following instructions sometimes. But the fact that I got all this done was super enjoyable and relieving for me! I got to try out the many transitions Premiere Pro has to offer, and figured out the basics of the application, which really was what I had hoped to achieve during the session. I really look forward to using more of this application and learning more of its effects!
