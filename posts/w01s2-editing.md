# Slides

The slides talked about the definition of self portrait and discussed many different kinds of shots and transitions used in design and editing, such as crossfade, match-cut and etc. During the time after slides, we had to share the 30s footage we shot from the homework last session with another and practice editing techniques.

While editing, I watched a tutorial on Premiere Pro given in the Discord channel, AT1-Resources, and practiced the keyboard shortcuts since I'm still not used to them.

I first imported both video files into Premiere Pro, before deciding to try out the different simple transitions I've learnt in class.

Then I moved to the 30s mark of the composition video so I can trim it to the exact frame.
