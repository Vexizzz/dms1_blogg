In class, we learnt about the concept of grids and how they serve to make everything seem neat and tidy. We had to choose a website and figure out the grid for it. I chose Pinterest... before realising it was almost impossible and I gave up right before my time ended. On the other hand, thus, I decided to incorporate the use of grids in my design using a grid of pink and white boxes which would suit my design's colour palette:

Furthermore, I made sure to keep a consistent text size for the body paragraph sizes as well as taking note of hierarchy using font size and boldness: Title > Project >= Body >= Decorative Elements.
