# Slides and Activity

We discussed sound design and the different qualities it has. We had to split into groups as well and analysed materialization and synchresis based off a video before presenting our answers to the class. The scene we had chosen was one from StarWars;

# Homework

I think a key moment in my assignment would probably be the scene with the sparklers at the beach. I feel like it would be such a key scene in trying to envoke nostalgia since fireworks, especially sparklers, are pivotal in childhood memories and playing around. 

The emotional tone would be nostalgic and have a sense of longingness, and to support this, I'd choose a calming soundtrack for the music, and if possible include relaxing and simple piano, or simply acoustic guitar. I feel like these two instruments are the best at doing their job of producing these kinds of emotional vibes in their soundtracks. Because of that, I think a slower pace and tempo would suit this mood better, thus longer cuts and more L-cuts to emphasize the longing for the previous scene more.

Furthermore, I want the sound of the sparklers lighting up and crackling to be included as well, since it'll emphasize their importance and the scene will feel more "raw" and "authentic". I hope this connects to the audience and helps them relate and be more immersed into this sparkler scene, and let themself be in this reminiscent scene.

I also hope that the connections of the shots at the beach help them realize that what they will be watching is centred on the whole feeling of nostalgia and reminiscing, especially since its one of the very first scenes of the video. With the person wearing a school uniform, and a sunset in the background to symbolize transition to a new beginning. 

I've included these suggestions in the assignment storyboard while brainstorming,
