# CLASS ACTIVITY

![Brainstorm](/w07s1/brainstorm.png)

For class, we had to make a solar system. It was my first time using Unity, and I learnt how to place textures onto objects, as well as familiarised myself with the key and navigation controls. 



I also learnt how to edit the properties of a shape, such as a sphere for example, in order to make it the ring of a planet.



One additional thing I learnt that I think would be important for my assignment later on is how to change the skybox texture by simply dragging it onto the sky, since it would be necessary to change the default sky. This is especially so since Unity has many different beautiful textures which I think would add to the aesthetics of my 3D environment.

# HOMEWORK

As homework, we had to brainstorm and develop ideas for our Assignment Task 3. We were asked to design a 3D environment based on a meaningful change or transformation that I had undergone, so I wrote down some words and themes that I thought I would use as the foundation for my design decisions.

And with these ideas, I drew a top-down map. It is about the premise of "change" that I try to show by telling a story of growing up all the while being stuck reminiscing in the past. The subway train brings the player to different stops of the character's past memories, a vessel for looking between different times in the players life; their old classroom, and past of being a feeble sick kid. Going up and out the station and finally leaving your past behind, you enter a bright modern city that is different from the apocalyptic, messy overgrown subway station. It represents the "change" in mindset when finally stopping yourself from being stuck or tied down by the past, and how much better your perspective on things can be which is something I had often found myself doing. This habit frequently led to many negative thoughts and being stuck in a constant cycle of regret and not being able to move into the future.

Thus, I started researching on assets, sounds and textures that I might be using for my environment:
