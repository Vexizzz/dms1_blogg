# Self Reflection

In class and in groups of three, we had to interview and ask one another the questions on the slide.

I jot them down in my iPad before moving on to the next sections.

# Thought Process & Documentation Strategy

For my webpage, I aim to showcase both my process and progress as a practitioner throughout the semester. I want the layout to offer insight into the context I envisioned my work to be in while designing each aspect,my process in designing it and highlighting the meaning and theme of my creative projects.

To convey this, Iâ€™ll use a blog-like structure where it seems like scrolling through a blog website, just like this DMS1 Blog. I feel like this will allow users feel more engaged and interested in the refleciton

# Key Words for Webpage Aesthetics

Minimalist: Clean design that draws focus to the content without visual clutter.

Flow: A smooth, continuous user experience which doesn't feel cut up and separate when transitoning through each project.

Old school(?): Since a lot of my projects focus on nostalgia and looking back at the past, I think it would be cool and engaging to have the webpage give a feel of looking through an old cocmputer.

# Target Audience

The webpage will primarily cater to:

Peers and collaborators: Those interested in the narrative themes explored in my projects.

Future collaborators: Anyone seeking to understand my creative identity and and experience in the design industry.

Millenials to GenZ, especially those who are interested in technology and design.

# Features Desired by the Audience

Project descriptions: Insight into the themes and inspirations behind each work.

Artist Statement: To understand the artist as well as how their works are influenced by themself as  person.

Reflection sections: Blog-style entries highlighting challenges, how the project was achieved, and what i hopes to achieve.

Interactivity: Engaging elements, such as buttons to move through different sections for better accessibility.

Responsive design: Compatibility across different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
