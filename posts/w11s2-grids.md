# Class Assignment
In class, we learnt about the concept of grids and how they serve to make everything seem neat and tidy. We had to choose a website and figure out the grid for it. I chose Pinterest... before realising it was almost impossible and I gave up right before my time ended. On the other hand, thus, I decided to incorporate the use of grids in my design using a grid of pink and white boxes which would suit my design's colour palette:

Furthermore, I made sure to keep a consistent text size for the body paragraph sizes as well as taking note of hierarchy using font size and boldness: Title > Project >= Body >= Decorative Elements.

I started drawing decorative elements, such as the icons as well as the boxes that I would be putting my body paragraphs in, and even an avatar for myself. I did all this using a mobile app on my iPad called Pixsquare. I had difficulties at first since it was my first time doing pixel art but I got the hang of it for a while.

Using a drawing app, I would place them on grids as reference on how I would want them to look like and fix my compositions. I would ask other people their thoughts on the positioning of the elements, the sizes, and if the decorations were too distracting before working on the other slides.

Afterwards, I would import all the elements and layers onto my laptop and typeset it on Adobe Photoshop with the Orange Kid font. While typesetting, I wanted to further emphasise and put more attention onto the title rather than the body. I did this by making the body significantly smaller than the title, making the title bold, and also making it all-caps while the body text is all lower-caps.
